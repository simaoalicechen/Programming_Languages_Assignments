--Write	a	program	to	find	all	pairs	of	numbers	in	a	given	list	--which	add	up	to	a	given	sum
--eg.	if	list	=	(1,3,8,12,7,11,9,4,2,10,5) and	sum =	12
--pair: (1,11),	(2,10),	(3,9),	(4,8)
--Input:	a	list	of	numbers	and	a	sum
--Output:	The	list	of	pairs	with	the	respective	sum
--Extend	your	program	to	include	all	possible	sums
--eg.	Sums	=	5,	6,	7,	8,	â€¦,	23
--Input:	A	list	of	numbers
--Output:	a	list	of	tuples	where	each	tuple	is	the	sum	--followed	by	the	list	of	pairs.
